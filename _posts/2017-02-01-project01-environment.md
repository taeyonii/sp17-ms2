## Design Qustion
How can people rely on a box to keep the visual appeal of color alive?

### World We Set
This is a fictional world where everything is black and white. There is no color.
The only way to see color is by going to a special small box on every corner and looking through it to see color.
The visual appeal of color will only last a few seconds. A moment of appreciating color is all someone needs. In order to see color again, you need to go back to the box.

#### Audience
People who lost colors in their life.
