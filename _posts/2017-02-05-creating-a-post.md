What I ultimately meant to say through prototyping was that some media (games in this article) could serve as a bridge between individuals and society. The best part of this article was that the game was to change the perception through the play process. Therefore, we set up the same objects in different environments, so that the audience can change their perception of the space. This is a kind of play. The rules of this project are as follows.

![project00][prototype]

(Number of participants required = Number of spaces)
1. The participant enters each space painted in a different color.
2. Each space is decorated with the same structure and objects (same arrangement). The only difference is the color painted in the room.
3. Participants are not provided with any information about the spaces they do not enter.
4. After a period of time, come out and discuss each other’s space.
5. After you have finished sharing the space, go into a different space than the first, and relocate things based on the information you’ve been given to other people.
6. Compare the initial appearance of the space with the rearranged appearance.
