# Proposal
## Goals
to critically consider the psychological relationships that people have with objects; how an interface creates meaning; how it structures and facilitates relationships; what an affordance is and how it affects usage and meaning.
## Concept Statement
We are creating an egg shaped object that will contain elements of surprise to bring life and happiness to humans.
## Design Questions
How might we create an object that will be representative of new life/growth/and happiness?
## Audience
Adults, people who are really stressed out. Suburban 50’s or older. People who have anxiety.
Meaning Representative of childhood. And things that are useful such as a shoelace and fun things like a bouncy ball.
## Affordance
To crack the egg shaped object open and finding the surprises inside.

### Wonderball

The Wonder Ball is a spherical candy, which weighs 3 grams, has an outer shell that is pure milk chocolate and a hollow interior containing candies. The wonder ball is wrapped in foil, placed in a small box, and packaged with a collectible sticker.

### Eggs
### Happiness came from environments project
### Senses: touch seeing

# Prototype01

![proto1.2](/sp17-ms2/assets/img/project_obj/proto01_2.jpg)
We made an egg shaped paper container and we filled it with sundries and sealed it. Some are representative of someone's memories, some are useful things, some give little happiness.

# Prototype02
![proto2.1](/sp17-ms2/assets/img/project_obj/proto02_1.jpg)
![proto2.2](/sp17-ms2/assets/img/project_obj/proto02_2.jpg)
The material of the container was changed to make it more firm and not to transparent.
The biggest change was that everyone in the class had to experience this object. Because everyone's experience was individual, we could receive various feedbacks.
### Items in the `Genesis`
: Bubble gum, bouncy ball, cable tie, string, Hershey’s Chocolate, yellow confetti paper

# Prototype03
![proto3.1](/sp17-ms2/assets/img/project_obj/proto03.jpg)

I focused on my personal experience in the last iterartion. The small works that I make with hands are joy and little happiness to me.
So I used my own customized attiny board to represent my joyful memories, and did some simple physical computing work.
