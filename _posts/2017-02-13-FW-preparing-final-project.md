Based on the reading,
Propose 3 questions that might be my final project question.

The question has to get you mad, make you laugh, make you sad, make you want to ponder the question forever..

1. Why we define game and play as a different thing? Isn't there also rules set and compensations in play?
2. Can't we make game without rules?
3. Does the basic system of game really helps people to immerse? How can I break the rules?

	* 'You can write your own rules, of course.'
	* (artificial sensorium)

Pick 1 burning question that lights you on fire! You can steal questions from each other. Write a short paragraph about what you already know about one question. It dows not matter that you don't know what to MAKE yet.
1. Write your 'assumptions' about the question. What do most people assume about the question?
2. Riff for a minute about what you could make around the question(s) you selected. Change your question if you need to.

### Selected Question
Does the basic system of game really helps people to immerse?
How can I break the rules?

### Answer
What if there's a 'game' that cannot be defined with commonly used game system, is it still can be classified as a game?
