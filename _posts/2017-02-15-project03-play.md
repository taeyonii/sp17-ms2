# Proposal
I brought the 'Nervous Hatcher' as a medium of play project. The purpose of this project is giving a chance to comfort to audiences who are living in the exhausted life by interacting with a physical object. We will console each other.(This is not a game. It is a kind of installation.)

My last iteration of the play project involves consecutive three projects from a specific worldview. This is a kind of instruction in a play project. Through the process of solving this puzzle, the audiences can get a hint to how the 'A Nervous Hatcher' will work, and at the same time, it is a chance to see what we have forgotten in our life.
