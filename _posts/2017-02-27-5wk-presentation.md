# Summary
![diagram](/sp17-ms2/assets/img/5wk_presentation/presentation.005.jpeg)

This Venn diagram illustrates the relationship between each project.
+ Worldview: A monotonous and vigorless world.
+ Solution: Install spirited beings.
+ Primer: Affordance of the object(incubate/nurse/crack).

## Environment > Play Color
I and Estee set the environment as a greyscaled world and we tried to figure out how people will react to visual variations that they couldn't experience before.
## Object > Genesis
I, Danielle, and Estee made eggs that contain little happiness in it with the affordance of cracking.
## Play > A Nervous Hatcher
I wanted to interact with audiences by giving them a weird experience. I intended that my object and audiences can console each other.
## End of the itinerary

My last iteration of the play project involves consecutive three projects from a specific worldview. This is a kind of instruction in a play project. Through the process of solving this puzzle, the audiences can get a hint to how the 'A Nervous Hatcher' will work, and at the same time, it is a chance to see what we have forgotten in our life.
