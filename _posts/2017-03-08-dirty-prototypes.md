> `Role prototypes` are those which are built primarily to investigate questions of *what an artifact could do for a user*.

> `Look and feel prototypes` are built primarily to explore and demonstrate options *for the concrete experience of an artifact*.

> `Implemetation prototypes` are built primarily *to answer technical questions* about how a future artifact might actually be made to work.

# Project Proposal
I suggest entertaining contents that are satisfying the five human senses with a tangible interface. The device is making visual, auditory, and tactile information. The animation to be screened on this device encourages the sense of taste and smell with its narrative.

+ How do we make immersive experience without blocking peopleâ€™s sight?
+ How do we create empathy in mediated experiences?

# Prototype03: Implementation
```
//pseudo code for 'project: Tangible'

loop{
	if(audience){
		play(intro);
		while(object_box){
			if(detect hand.both_side){
				tangible_mapping();
				screen(object_box);
			}
		}
	}else{
		play(sound attraction);
	}
}

tangible_mapping(){
	camera = on;
	object scannig in real time;
	make 3D.depth.map;
}
screen(box_input){
	anim = load_contents(box_input)
	animate(3D.depth.map, anim);
}
```
