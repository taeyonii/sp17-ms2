# Field Trip
To feel the various textures, I made the field trip to park and fabric shop. I could find many textures in the park, but I thought it is hard to manage natural objects when I use them physically. So, I visited a fabric shop([Mood Fabrics](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Mood+Fabrics/@40.7537152,-73.9925835,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c259ac5d8d2d57:0xcc27d0a9639a444!8m2!3d40.7537152!4d-73.9903948)) which have durable and varied textures.

# Material Objects
I collected swatches which have the feeling of nature. For example, feathers, fur, spangles, metalic cloth, artificial leather, etc.
Finally, I made 8pcs of material objects.
