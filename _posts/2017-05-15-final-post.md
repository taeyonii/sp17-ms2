*Tangible* is a VR quiz game with a tangible mystery box. A touch and feel box that contains various textural surfaces allows the player to activate and match the mystery texture with a visual representation in the VR head mounted display. It has creatures in the three dimensional virtual world whose materiality is undefined visually and player can match their touch of feeling to description of creaturesâ€™ identity. The project is for 15 to 30 aged digital natives who are familiar with digital technology and spend a significant amount of time touching digital screens in their everyday lives.

This is the first working prototype of 'mystery box'. I laser cut the cardboard and make inputs with arduino. Players can feel each of textures and match them to each creature rely on the description about its identity.
When the player have the right answer, the material of creature in the VR world will be changed. If you have the wrong answer, the player will lose one of creatures. Give the right name and get reality.

# Soundtrack
I designed background music for this game.
