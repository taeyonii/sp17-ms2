       <p>Based on the reading,
Propose 3 questions that might be my final project question.</p>

<p>The question has to get you mad, make you laugh, make you sad, make you want to ponder the question forever..</p>

<ol>
  <li>Why we define game and play as a different thing? Isn’t there also rules set and compensations in play?</li>
  <li>Can’t we make game without rules?</li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the basic system of game really helps people to immerse? How can I break the rules?</p>

    <ul>
      <li>‘You can write your own rules, of course.’</li>
      <li>(artificial sensorium)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="free-write-02">Free write 02</h2>
<p>Pick 1 burning question that lights you on fire! You can steal questions from each other. Write a short paragraph about what you already know about one question. It dows not matter that you don’t know what to MAKE yet.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Write your ‘assumptions’ about the question. What do most people assume about the question?</li>
  <li>Riff for a minute about what you could make around the question(s) you selected. Change your question if you need to.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="selected-question">Selected Question</h3>
<p>Does the basic system of game really helps people to immerse?
How can I break the rules?</p>

<h3 id="answer">Answer</h3>
<p>What if there’s a ‘game’ that cannot be defined with commonly used game system, is it still can be classified as a game?</p>

<p>As like many game design reseachers say,</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Domain</dt>
  <dd>Game / Interface /</dd>
