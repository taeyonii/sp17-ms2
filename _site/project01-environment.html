<h1 id="proposal">Proposal</h1>
<h2 id="design-qustion">Design Qustion</h2>
<p>How can people rely on a box to keep the visual appeal of color alive?</p>

<h2 id="world-we-set">World We Set</h2>
<p>This is a fictional world where everything is black and white. There is no color.
The only way to see color is by going to a special small box on every corner and looking through it to see color.
The visual appeal of color will only last a few seconds. A moment of appreciating color is all someone needs. In order to see color again, you need to go back to the box.</p>

<h2 id="audience">Audience</h2>
<p>People who lost colors in their life.</p>

<h2 id="precedents">Precedents</h2>
<h3 id="black-and-white-television">Black and White Television</h3>
<p>People who were familiar with black and white screen shocked by the first color TV. The splendid colors on the screen was enough to attract people even they know the existence of colors. Information flooding from tv seemed more like truth compared to the previous media, and it brought enormous changes in the structure of industry and consumption.</p>

<h3 id="bookmovie-the-giver">Book/Movie: The Giver</h3>
<p>The movie starts in black and white screen. Jonas, who lives a happy life in a  system without war, discrimination, poverty, and pain, is given the task of ‘memory receiver’. Through training with the memory receiver, Jonas learns the color of things, their real appearance, and the existence of memory, emotion, and freedom of choice. He fights to deliver the memories that have been removed from everyone.</p>

<h3 id="light-installation-colored-forrest">Light Installation: Colored Forrest</h3>
<p>Colored Forrest consisted of a lamp that moved across a forrest and created a spectacular choreography of patterns of colored shadows. By entering the CMYK lit area, shadows came to life and installation challenge the audience to interact with the light and to create shapes and compositions of colored shadows.</p>

<p><em>These three precedents show <strong>how light and color affect human’s perception and behavior</strong>. We have envisioned a world where color has disappeared for unknown reasons and thought how humans would react to owning color if it existed only in <strong>limited time and place.</strong></em></p>
