Major Studio 2 provides first year MFA Design & Technology students with a context for further developing their focus as an artist or designer within a technology-driven environment. While the aims of Major Studio One were to distinguish concept from form, and to introduce the process of iterative design; the focus of Major Studio Two is geared toward working with systems, designing for engagement, and designing for contexts where not all variables are known (i.e. speculation). Emphasis will be placed on process and concept, regardless of the media employed. The end goal of Major Studio 2 is to refine individual creative practice and working methodology by exploring creative modes of prototyping and research; supported by analytical discussion in a critique-based studio environment.
